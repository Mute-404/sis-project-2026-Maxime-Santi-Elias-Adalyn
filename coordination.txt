Suggestions from group members:
At first, Elias thought watches would be a good idea, which was quickly countersuggested by Adalyn, who wanted to write about glasses. Maxime was still at the infrastructure meeting and didn't have any suggestions yet. In the end, Santi recommended chocolate, a a product that everyone was familiar with. However when Maxime heard the chocolate idea, he wasn't convinced, since it wasn't very revolutionary
Decision/Theme:
In the end, we also asked the teacher if choclate was a good idea and he accepted it, and so it was unanimously accepted by the group.
Division of Tasks:
Adalyn had to make sure to find a fitting image for our website, came up with the logo, which is very creative and also wrote a paragraph.
Elias came up with the description of our product and made sure to control how far we were coming along and how well we were doing, as well as checkong spelling.
Maxime help build the foundation of our website and assisted us with implementing our ideas into code.
Santi made sure to keep the work flow of the group organised
