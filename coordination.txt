Suggestions from group members:
At first, Elias thought watches would be a good idea, which was quickly countersuggested by Adalyn, who wanted to write about glasses. Maxime was still at the infrastructure meeting and didn't have any suggestions yet. In the end, Santi recommended chocolate, a product that everyone was familiar with. However when Maxime heard the chocolate idea, he wasn't convinced, since it wasn't very revolutionary
Decision/Theme:
In the end, we also asked the teacher if chocolate was a good idea and he accepted it, and so it was unanimously accepted by the group.
Division of Tasks:
Adalyn had to make sure to find a fitting image for our website, came up with the logo, which is very creative and also wrote the paragraph "Schokolade Macht Glücklich".
Elias came up with the description "Ein Stück Glück" and made sure to control how far we were coming along and how well we were doing, as well as checking spelling.
Maxime help build the foundation of our website and assisted us with implementing our ideas into code. He also created a paragraph "Kraft in einem Stück" for the product and designed the website a bit nicer.
Santi made sure to keep the work flow of the group organised and noted down the events that occured during the work process. Finally, he also wrote and the argumentative paragraph "Süsser Fokus".
